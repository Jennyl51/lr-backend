- Representing graph in the range [0-100, 0-100]
- Minimum distance of 5, considering:
    - Physical distance in miles
    - Weighted edges
        - Frequency of crimes, severity, how recent crime was
        - Crime (string), severity (integer to represent how heinous a crime is), timestamps (date)
- Dijktra's:
    - Gives you the cheapest path from a source vertex to every other vertex in the graph
        - cheapest as in smallest total weight
    - Uses a priority queue (heap)
    - Needs non-negative edge weights
- A*
    - Gives you the cheapest path from a source vertex to a particular target
    - Will run faster, using a heuristic to generally push the path in the right direction
        - e.g. if you start from the center and want to go to the top-right, the heuristics will push you top-right
